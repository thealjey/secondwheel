# webutilities
unopinionated library of functions for those tired of reinventing the wheel

## Philosophy:
1. use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) for everything
1. tiny, reusable, pure, side effect free functions, following a single
   responsibility principle
1. no transpilation
1. full test and type coverage
1. tests cover contracts, not internal implementation
1. simple, complete, automatically generated API documentation
1. fast and minimal
1. flexible
1. having as few dependencies as possible
1. no reliance on any framework
1. fully automated release process
